        “Blog” is an abbreviated version of “weblog,” which is a term used to
        describe websites that maintain an ongoing chronicle of information. A
        blog features diary-type commentary and links to articles on other
        websites, usually presented as a list of entries in reverse
        chronological order. Blogs range from the personal to the political, and
        can focus on one narrow subject or a whole range of subjects. Many blogs
        focus on a particular topic, such as web design, home staging, sports,
        or mobile technology. Some are more eclectic, presenting links to all
        types of other sites. And others are more like personal journals,
        presenting the author’s daily life and thoughts.
